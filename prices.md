Dear Valued Training Customers & Clients:

Since Lenox Fit was purchased in 2014 by Sue Merritt, Personal Training rates have remained the same. In order to keep up with the rising cost of doing business and provide our trainers with a more competitive rate that is in line with current pricing here in the Berkshires, we will be implementing a new rate structure effective January 1, 2024.

While we understand that this might seem like a big leap in our pricing, we need to take steps to bring ourselves up to the current pricing standard for Personal Training and recognize the value that our Training Staff brings to Lenox Fit.

Our new Structure will include a Two-Tiered approach. Pricing for Trainers with over 3 years of experience will differ from trainers with less. Training rates will be structured as follows:

Master trainer (Sue Merritt, Erica Pelton, Ashli Minor)

Packages will now be sold in groups of 10 (discounted) or as a single session:

Singles:

$75 per hour

$50 per ½ hour

10 Pack:

$700 for 10 (1-hour sessions)

$480 for 10 (1/2-hour sessions)

Trainer (Josh Conant, Karen Tibbetts, Ethan Dean)

Packages will now be sold in groups of 10 (discounted) or as a single session:
